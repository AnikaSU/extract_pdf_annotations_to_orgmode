* Extracting RepliGo PDF annotations to a Org-mode format snippet

I annotate PDF research paper files on my tablet using
[[http://www.cerience.com/products/reader/android][RepliGo Reader for Android]]. Because I am managing my research papers
within [[http://orgmode.org][Org-mode]] similar to [[http://tincman.wordpress.com/2011/01/04/research-paper-management-with-emacs-org-mode-and-reftex/][this description]] I want to get the PDF
annotations back out from the PDF files and into my Org-mode files.

Since RepliGo stores its annotations very parser-friendly (it's text!)
and Org-mode is just text, I can add something like this into Org-mode:

: #+begin_src sh :results output
: ${HOME}/bin/vkextract_annotations_to_orgmode_snippet.sh Qian2008
: #+end_src

When I execute this in Org-mode (using babel: C-c C-c) its text output
gets back right below:
